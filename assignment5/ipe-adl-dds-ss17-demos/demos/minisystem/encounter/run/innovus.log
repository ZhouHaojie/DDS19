Extraction called for design 'minisystem_top' of instances=15462 and nets=1937 using extraction engine 'preRoute' .
PreRoute RC Extraction called for design minisystem_top.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(2) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.

**WARN: (IMPSYC-2):	Timing information is not defined for cell SJKA65_512X32X1CM4; Check the timing library (.lib) file and make sure the timing information exists for the cell and you can run the checkTimingLibrary command to verify if the timing library has complete information after the design is loaded.
Type 'man IMPSYC-2' for more detail.
